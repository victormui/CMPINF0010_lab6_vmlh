- Our program asks for the users name and the users favorite food. It then concatenates the food after every letter in the users name and prints it out. 
- Open the file in Jupyterhub and enter your name as the program requests. 
- Go on jupyterhub, open the console, and type in git clone https://github.com/victormui/CMPINF0010_lab6_vmlh . This will install the github repository in your jupyterhub. Then open the folder and open the jupyter notebook and proceed with the program.
